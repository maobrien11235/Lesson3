# Lesson3
## Merge conflict example for MRMV Continuous Learning
This lesson will cover a simple merge conflict within git. I will be using the code example found online here: https://coderwall.com/p/o1psnw/handle-a-git-merge-conflict with corresponding GitHub repo here: https://github.com/connor11528/mergeConflicting/commits/master.

## Lessons learned
The current advanced merging example in the Git Pro book in chapter 7.8 was abandoned because the intended conflict of DOS whitespace and carriage returns were automatically fixed according to a git's checkout process which standardized the files even after multpile manual unix2dos commands. Thus, I chose another off-the-shelf example from the web that highlights git's mergetool command.
